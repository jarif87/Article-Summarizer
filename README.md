# Text-Summarizer

***Utilizing Hugging Face Transformers and Blurr, I streamlined data scraping and text summarization. Three specialized models were integrated seamlessly, allowing for accurate summaries. Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces ensured easy sharing and accessibility. This project showcases the efficiency of modern NLP for succinct text summarization.***

# Web Deployment

***I've developed a Flask application specifically for text summarization. It's designed to take input text and generate a condensed summary. You're invited to explore the Flask branch to delve into the implementation details further. To try out the application in real-time, simply visit the live website accessible through the provided [link](https://text-summarizer-z6vl.onrender.com/).***
